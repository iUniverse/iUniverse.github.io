##Life is playground

This is so weirdo.. I didn't think much about it before but it's getting more interesthing.. Everything have reason in this world. Every raindrops every tick tock every laughs every bits every traffic lights.. this means this is Butterfly effect? why is this listening so weird ? Think and think..
What's the most important thing in the world?
What's the purpose of life?
What's the meaning of life?
When world is born? If it's started somewhere in the time when it's end..

The most important things said by Mr. Nobody
	Did I really alive enough?
	I am afraid I haven't been alive enough..
	Life is a PLAYGROUND - OR - NOTHING. iA
